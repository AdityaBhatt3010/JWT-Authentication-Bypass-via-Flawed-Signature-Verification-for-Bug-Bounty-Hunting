**Lab:** JWT authentication bypass via flawed signature verification <br/>

> Exploit insecure JWT signature verification by forcing the algorithm to `none` and stripping the signature to gain unauthorized admin access.

## üîç Introduction

JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are a common method for stateless authentication, where a token is issued after login and validated on subsequent requests. However, misconfigurations can lead to critical security flaws ‚Äî such as accepting tokens with no signature at all.

In this lab, we‚Äôll exploit such a misconfiguration to forge a token without a signature and gain administrator access.

## üîê JWT in a Nutshell: The 3 Key Parts

A JWT consists of three base64-encoded components, separated by dots (`.`):

```
<Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>
```

### 1. **Header**

Specifies metadata about the algorithm used for signing:

```json
{ "alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT" }
```

### 2. **Payload**

Contains user claims such as user ID or privileges:

```json
{ "sub": "wiener", "admin": false }
```

### 3. **Signature**

Used to verify the authenticity of the token. It is created by hashing the header and payload with a secret key.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Vulnerability Focus:**
If the server accepts a token with `alg: none` and ignores the signature, an attacker can forge tokens with arbitrary data and bypass authentication.

## üéØ Lab Objective

> Modify your JWT to access the `/admin` panel as the `administrator` user and delete `carlos`.

## üß™ Proof-of-Concept (PoC)

**Step-by-step Walkthrough:**

1. **Access the JWT Lab**
   Visit: [Lab URL](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/lab-jwt-authentication-bypass-via-flawed-signature-verification) and log in with the credentials:

   ```
   Username: wiener  
   Password: peter
   ```
  
  ![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1ff83ef-a0ab-49fc-92e1-f828f787e740) <br/>
  
2. **Try the `/admin` Endpoint**
   Intercept the request to `/admin` using Burp Suite. You'll get:

   ```
   Admin interface only available if logged in as an administrator
   ```
  ![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32e575f1-5468-42a0-a8d4-ebb593bcc27a) <br/>
  
3. **Send to Repeater**
   Send the request to **Burp Repeater**. Observe that the JWT token's payload contains:

   ```json
   "sub": "wiener"
   ```
  
  ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/270f28bb-9425-4987-8279-f95aa1fe1ff5) <br/>

4. **Modify Payload**
   In the **Inspector** panel, update the `sub` claim from `wiener` to `administrator`. Click **Apply changes**.

  ![administrator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e6cef27-5695-4b15-b988-19e570b8263a) <br/>

5. **Change Header Algorithm to None**
   Still in the Inspector, edit the JWT header to:

   ```json
   { "alg": "none" }
   ```

   ![Alg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78c56ee4-ccf4-4563-8488-1488cc17ce6f) <br/>
   
   Apply the changes.

7. **Strip Signature**
   In the raw request editor, remove the signature segment of the JWT entirely ‚Äî **but keep the trailing dot**. Your token should look like:

   ```
   <base64(header)>.<base64(payload)>.
   ```
  
  ![Alg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78c56ee4-ccf4-4563-8488-1488cc17ce6f) <br/>
  
8. **Send Request to /admin**
   Hit **Send**. Boom ‚Äî you're now in the **admin panel** as `administrator`.

  ![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57825355-50c9-4a68-becb-bff6f3b27e02) <br/>


9. **Delete Carlos**
   In the response, find the delete endpoint:

   ```
   /admin/delete?username=carlos
   ```

   Send a request to this endpoint using Burp or browser to solve the lab.

## ‚úÖ Lab Status: **Solved**

You‚Äôve successfully exploited a JWT misconfiguration where the server accepts unsigned tokens ‚Äî a classic yet dangerous flaw.

## üß† Key Takeaways

* Always validate JWT signatures on the server-side.
* Reject tokens that use `alg: none`.
* Use libraries that enforce strict algorithm checks and signature verification.
* Do not trust client-controlled data blindly ‚Äî especially authentication tokens.
